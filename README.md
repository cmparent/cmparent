### Hi!

👋 I'm Charlotte Parent, and I'm a rising junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in Information Science (Information Analysis path) and in English. I'm from Grosse Pointe Park, MI, and I am a current Digital Product Management intern at SiteOne Landscape Supply. As a lifelong learner, passionate wordsmith, and determined problem solver, I thrive in hands-on, fast-paced environments.

👩‍💻 I consider myself a technologist. I love writing lines of code until my eyes go blurry just as much as fooling around with wireframes in Figma. I strive to combine my creative and analytical skillsets in interdisciplinary, entrepreneurial roles, seeking out challenges that put me outside my comfort zone and allow me to innovate collaboratively.

👥 I eagerly immerse myself in work experiences and communities that will allow me to learn, grow, and work together other technologists. Such experinces include PM, Business Analyst, & UX Design internships at national landscape supply distributors, sustainability-focused VC incubators, & edtech startups, TA positions in undergraduate Python and graduate SQL classes, and leadership positions in professional design fraternities and UX-focused clubs.

📚 Outside the classroom, I am an avid reader, writer, and violist. I enjoy cheering on Michigan (fortunately) and Detroit sports (unfortunately), collecting planners & notebooks, and taking way too many pictures of sunsets. I am an ENFJ, an ennegram 3, and think I am be a Ravenclaw but am actually a Hufflepuff.

📩 I am always curious to learn about future opportunies, particulary in product management, data engineering/data science, and consulting. Please feel free to reach out to me at **cmparent at umich dot edu**.
